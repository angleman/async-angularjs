async-angularjs
====================================

Loading files with RequireJS is great, but once you have the modules loaded it's a bit tricky to register them with the bootstrapped angular module.  This sample app shows you how to setup a little utility I called lazy-angular.js, which will allow you to register controllers, directives, factories and filters.

This project is an enhancement of Mateusz Bilski's https://github.com/matys84pl/angularjs-requirejs-lazy-controllers

## Usage

Run 'npm start' to start the server, then go to localhost:3000 to see the sample application
